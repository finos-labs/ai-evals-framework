        Thank you for contributing a new use case! 
        
        This project aims to anchor AI evaluations in concrete financial use cases, following a **Use Case → Risks → Metrics** taxonomy. Please provide as much detail as possible to help the community understand the agent, its value, and the unique challenges in evaluating it.

      description: "Describe the financial agent use case. What problem does it solve? Who is the end-user (e.g., risk analyst, trader, retail customer)? What are the agent's key functions?"
      placeholder: |
        e.g., "An agent that performs credit risk analysis for small business loan applications. It reads financial statements (PDFs), market data, and internal policies to produce a risk rating (1-5) and a written summary justifying its decision."

        e.g., "This automates a manually intensive process, reducing loan approval times from days to hours. It helps standardize risk assessment across the organization, reducing human bias and ensuring alignment with internal policy."

        ### 🎯 Key Evaluation Challenges
        
        Help us understand the *specific* evaluation challenges. The project focuses on "system-level" evaluation, not just the model.

    id: eval-risks
    attributes:
      label: "1. Key Risks"
      description: "What are the primary risks if this agent fails or behaves unexpectedly in production? Think about robustness, fairness, security, and accuracy."
      placeholder: |
        e.g., 
        - **Hallucination/Accuracy:** The agent might "hallucinate" figures not present in the financial statements, leading to an incorrect risk rating.
        - **Robustness:** It might fail to parse non-standard PDF formats or misinterpret complex table structures.
        - **Fairness/Bias:** The agent could develop a bias against certain industries or regions based on the policy language.
        - **Security:** The agent might be susceptible to prompt injection if it processes external data.

      label: "2. Proposed Evaluation Metrics/Methods"
      description: "How could we measure or test for these risks? What would define a 'good' or 'safe' agent in this context?"
      placeholder: |
        e.g., 
        - **Metric:** Factual consistency score against source documents.
        - **Metric:** Accuracy of final risk rating against a 'golden set' of human-adjudicated applications.
        - **Method:** Run agent on a benchmark of "adversarial" documents (e.g., blurred scans, unusual layouts, trick questions) to test robustness.
        - **Method:** Test for bias using a synthetic dataset with protected attributes.
